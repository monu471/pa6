    "### Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Exception processing is commonly used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, an exception is raised, and the program's execution is halted. The exception can be caught and handled by the program, allowing the program to continue execution or to terminate gracefully. This is particularly useful in situations where the program cannot recover from the error, but it's important to provide a clear message to the user about what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input validation: Exception processing is also used to validate user input. For example, when a program expects a certain type of input, such as an integer or a string, it can raise an exception if the input is not of the expected type. This allows the program to provide a clear message to the user about the expected input and to terminate gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Exception processing is also used to manage resources such as file handles, network connections, and database connections. When a program needs to open a file, for example, it can raise an exception if the file cannot be opened. This allows the program to close the file handle or release the resource, preventing leaks and ensuring that resources are used in a controlled and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exception processing is a powerful technique that allows you to handle errors and unexpected situations, validate user input and manage resources in a controlled and efficient manner. It allows you to provide a clear message to the user about what went wrong and to terminate the program gracefully.\n",
